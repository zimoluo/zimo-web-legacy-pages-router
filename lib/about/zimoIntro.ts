Zimo. zimo. ZIMO. Eunoe. Kawarage. Choose your call – names comprise the soul. I'm a high school senior in Beijing. I do whatever I like. Say, mathematics. I'm somewhat into complex analysis and previously abstract algebra. I've been doing graph theory for quite a while, too. Currently retired from math to prepare for college app; will be back soon.

I like building projects. Apart from algorithm-focused CS I do a lot of programming – a fancier name would be *software engineering*. Full-stack engineer, kinda chill. My primary language is Python, but I'm currently switching to JavaScript ecosystem. I guess neither of the two is a perfect solution.

Avid Minecraft player. Technical survival, Datapack and mcfunction, Bedwars (sucks bad). My username is \`g2245820920\` on Java and \`WhiteGkings\` on Bedrock.

If you watch Star Wars then you're with me. If you're not with me then you're my enemy. Unless you're also Tolkien fan. In this case I should say, may the Star of Eärendil be with you.

I’m an Apple enthusiast, drawing inspiration from anything and everything Apple – products, design, philosophy, and (to a lesser extent) job opportunities. You might find shadows of Apple lingering on this website.

Ready to discuss some philosophy with me. Here comes a big fan of Nietzsche. I do some writing, though not a good one.
